					Experienced and driven technologist passionate about automation, innovation, and decentralization. My career has taken me down a path perfectly optimized to engage and contribute to the Web3 movement. I started as a software developer, grew into a scaled program Agilist, and am now maturing as a DAO summoner and operator. I’m a high-energy critical thinker with excellent communication skills with broad experience analyzing, troubleshooting, and solving issues within technical programs and systems. I’m personally and obsessively dedicated to the success of DAOs and the defense of freedom that they represent.

					<h5>Governance Solution Engineer</h5>

					<p>
					I was onboarded into BanklessDAO and leveled up through OpsGuild and the Sobol implementation working group. I went on to serve as website project champion and cofounded the FRAG Stack, a community-incentivized decentralized front-end web stack (think JAMstack but running on Radicle and IPFS). I took my learning from this experience and founded the Project Management Guild and <a href="https://www.themodernagilist.net/" target="_blank">The Modern Agilist Podcast</a> to bring experienced agile practitioners and Web3 Operators together. Current responsibilities as Governance Solution Engineer (GSE) include defining DAO governance and improving the community operating system. I’m the chief editor of the constitution and author of the improvement proposal process.

							<p>My conversations with Justice was one of the factors that began to peak my interest in crypto years ago. His passion for blockchain, and its understanding of its potential was obvious in our conversations. While some professionals in the space are only about hype, Justice would answer my questions in a way that demonstrated deep knowledge on the subject, clearly knowing crypto & blockchain inside and out. He has only continued to build on this passion and knowledge for blockchain over the years in his free time. Justice is someone who wants the best for the team, and wants to have a positive impact. He is a professional who wants to get along with everyone. He cares about getting it right, and if he doesn't he shows self awareness and camaraderie to smooth any bumps in the road. His technical ability, people skills, and understanding of how pieces of an organization should fit together is a rare find. The crypto space would benefit from Justice's deep knowledge of blockchain from both a product and technology perspective.</p>

							<p>Justice is an extremely passionate and talented individual which has made him a great coworker. His collaboration and problem solving abilities have helped to overcome a number of challenges that our organization has faced. Over the years Justice and I have worked very closely together and have managed a number of large teams and initiatives that have lead to successful and on-time releases. Justice is eager to learn and spends much of his time continuing to improve upon his knowledge of agile process and his skillset as a team leader. In addition to what he brings to the team as an agile leader, his personality is a light in the room and he is always very engaged and interested in getting to know his coworkers. It's been a pleasure working with Justice over the years!</p>

							<p>Justice is a great person to have in your organization. I’ve worked with a lot of Agilists, Product Managers, and Process People. And while all have had great intentions, not every one of them was cut out for the task at hand. Justice is razor sharp with Agile skills, but he has certain knack with soft and technical skills . That really helps him meld in to the SDLC, at the same time as melding into Product Steering. I’ve watched him execute, extremely complex planning sessions first hand. And over the past several years I’ve witnessed him saddle a somewhat unwieldy team, and helped shape it into a lean, process driven, human (patient) focused organization. He’s done all of this humbly, compassionately, diplomatically and with respect to all involved. And off of the record, he’s been a good friend.</p>

							<p>Justice is a passionate Sr. Scrum Master. He and I worked on AEM Project; his shared passion of Scrum mutually fostered a collaborative experience. He managed four teams consisting of twenty members to orchestrate the migration of three enterprise content management systems to Adobe Experience Manager. He lead agile ceremonies and introduced a Nexus-based Scrum of Scrums to deliver an improved cross-team product increment at the conclusion of every sprint. I do hope that we get to work on projects in future.</p>

							<p>Justice GETS IT. He is a hard worker and enjoys solving problems and finding ways to work
								better and more efficiently. Justice is also one of the most passionate people I have
								met in
								the industry and is a total technologist, enamored with the future of development and
								learning code. I know he's going to be an asset as other people become burned out and
								"set
								in their ways," Justice will continue to seek new answers and hone his skills and
								knowledge
								and make a great addition to any team who is looking to infuse not just another hand
								behind
								the wheel, but a life force into their collective.</p>

							<p> You won't find many developers around like Justice, and he'd make a great addition to
								any
								development team. Justice has a constant conquest to learn new tech, and the ability to
								carve out a strong development path for a new project. He also knows how to continue to
								move
								a project forward and get things done, while ensuring a project is still shipped with
								all
								intended deliverables. I strongly recommend Justice to any leading tech firm looking for
								an
								emerging developer to fit a demanding development position. </p>

							<p> Justice’s enthusiasm and positive attitude is contagious. All of his teammates fed off
								of
								his energy, and not one of them had a single negative thing to say about his management
								style or professional acumen. Additionally, Justice’s technical background as a
								developer
								sets him apart as a manager; his ability to decompose problems and articulate solutions
								with
								his peers made the difference in the success of the work his team accomplished. He
								constantly evangelized new technologies and encouraged many of his peers to invest in
								their
								own professional enrichment. The breadth of his skill sets is astounding, but his
								ability to
								inspire and encourage others is even more remarkable to me. I wouldn’t think twice if
								offered the opportunity to work with or collaborate with Justice in the future. Justice
								*is*
								that good. </p>

							<p>You will rarely find a manager with both technical and management skills. Justice has
								both. I
								always felt comfortable discussing requirements even from technical prospective. Justice
								is
								not like typical Manager, He is friendly and helping. I really admired his commitment
								and
								honesty with the organization. He has guts to reduce development time by adopting
								different
								programmatic approaches. I really liked his Idea of 'Programmatic transformation from
								Angular to AEM'. That was an amazing concept! I have no doubt that it reduced estimation
								from months to weeks, if not days. Not only did it gave piece of mind to the dev team,
								it
								also saved huge on org budget. Having a manager like Justice is a blessing. I believe,
								where
								ever he will go, wheather dev and org, both will be happy to have him.</p>

								life.
								Justice is one of those people. His passion for life, knowledge of technology, and his
								contagious enthusiasm will rub off on anyone he works or is friends with. There is no
								better
								person and/or technologist in North East Ohio, and probably the rest of the country for
								that
								matter. This may sound like a little much; it's not. Once you've met Justice you'll
								understand. He's truly a one-of-a kind person both personally and professionally. </p>

							<p> Justice has been simply the best CIO, the best project manager I ever met. He was a
								source
								of motivation, whatever he was giving me positive or negative feedbacks. I loved chosen
								technologies, professional and personal suggestions and basically all the way he was
								managing our remote team. From a professional point of view I would highly recommend
								him,
								without any hesitation. I... really hope we can work again together in the future. </p>

							<p> I really enjoyed working with Justice as he was one of few managers I've had who looked
								after the well being of his team. He was one of the most energetic leaders within the
								department that genuinely prioritized the quality of our team's output and finished
								product.
								Justice came in every day with a positive attitude that was contagious to the rest of
								our
								group and vital to keeping our team moral at its highest when things got rough. I
								consistently looked forward to our daily scrum and felt comfortable coming to him with
								any
								problems because he was always ready to make time to sit with me and find a solution. I
								admire him most for always looking at the bright side of any situation and finding a way
								to
								grow from it. He is personable, passionate, and has motivated me to stretch myself in
								new
								directions as a developer.</p>
