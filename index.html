							<p>You will rarely find a manager with both technical and management skills. Justice has
								both. I
								always felt comfortable discussing requirements even from technical prospective. Justice
								is
								not like typical Manager, He is friendly and helping. I really admired his commitment
								and
								honesty with the organization. He has guts to reduce development time by adopting
								different
								programmatic approaches. I really liked his Idea of 'Programmatic transformation from
								Angular to AEM'. That was an amazing concept! I have no doubt that it reduced estimation
								from months to weeks, if not days. Not only did it gave piece of mind to the dev team,
								it
								also saved huge on org budget. Having a manager like Justice is a blessing. I believe,
								where
								ever he will go, wheather dev and org, both will be happy to have him.</p>

							<p> Justice’s enthusiasm and positive attitude is contagious. All of his teammates fed off
								of
								his energy, and not one of them had a single negative thing to say about his management
								style or professional acumen. Additionally, Justice’s technical background as a
								developer
								sets him apart as a manager; his ability to decompose problems and articulate solutions
								with
								his peers made the difference in the success of the work his team accomplished. He
								constantly evangelized new technologies and encouraged many of his peers to invest in
								their
								own professional enrichment. The breadth of his skill sets is astounding, but his
								ability to
								inspire and encourage others is even more remarkable to me. I wouldn’t think twice if
								offered the opportunity to work with or collaborate with Justice in the future. Justice
								*is*
								that good. </p>

							<p> I really enjoyed working with Justice as he was one of few managers I've had who looked
								after the well being of his team. He was one of the most energetic leaders within the
								department that genuinely prioritized the quality of our team's output and finished
								product.
								Justice came in every day with a positive attitude that was contagious to the rest of
								our
								group and vital to keeping our team moral at its highest when things got rough. I
								consistently looked forward to our daily scrum and felt comfortable coming to him with
								any
								problems because he was always ready to make time to sit with me and find a solution. I
								admire him most for always looking at the bright side of any situation and finding a way
								to
								grow from it. He is personable, passionate, and has motivated me to stretch myself in
								new
								directions as a developer.</p>

							<p> They say that you meet a few people in your life that make an memorable impact on your

								Justice is one of those people. His passion for life, knowledge of technology, and his
								contagious enthusiasm will rub off on anyone he works or is friends with. There is no
								better
								person and/or technologist in North East Ohio, and probably the rest of the country for
								that
								matter. This may sound like a little much; it's not. Once you've met Justice you'll
								understand. He's truly a one-of-a kind person both personally and professionally. </p>

							<p>Justice GETS IT. He is a hard worker and enjoys solving problems and finding ways to work
								better and more efficiently. Justice is also one of the most passionate people I have
								met in
								the industry and is a total technologist, enamored with the future of development and
								learning code. I know he's going to be an asset as other people become burned out and
								"set
								in their ways," Justice will continue to seek new answers and hone his skills and
								knowledge
								and make a great addition to any team who is looking to infuse not just another hand
								behind
								the wheel, but a life force into their collective.</p>

							<p> You won't find many developers around like Justice, and he'd make a great addition to
								any
								development team. Justice has a constant conquest to learn new tech, and the ability to
								carve out a strong development path for a new project. He also knows how to continue to
								move
								a project forward and get things done, while ensuring a project is still shipped with
								all
								intended deliverables. I strongly recommend Justice to any leading tech firm looking for
								an
								emerging developer to fit a demanding development position. </p>

							<p> Justice is one of the most knowledgeable people in his industry. His strategic and

								Justice
								possesses such a love for life in general that when you spend long periods of time with
								him,
								that transfers to you. You will never regret a moment you get to work with him. Very
