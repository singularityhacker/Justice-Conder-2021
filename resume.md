## Work History

### Head of Growth & Innovation
**Thrive Protocol** | Aug 2025 - Jan 2026

Build the Thrive Guardian Network (TGN) API. Implemented TGN as an x402 gig economy. Created user deployable agents to use the gig economy to retrieve public diligent information about projects, structure it in datalake, and score projects based on private Thrive scoring rubrics.

### Cofounder
**Quadratic Accelerator** | Feb 2025 - Aug 2026

Founded and grew The Quadratic Accelerator (Q/Acc) bonding curve launchpad to top-ten launchpad by TVL (DefiLlama).

DAO Work: PolygonDAO grants committee. Ethereum Adoption DAO (EAD) and Metaverse Alliance DAO (MAD) coordinator. Labs work: Won every major DAO tooling infra deployment as DAO Tooling BD lead. Designed and spearheaded the community grants program which was the largest program in history at the time ($200M annual) value.

### Governance Solution Engineer
**BanklessDAO** | June 2021 - Feb 2023

I cut my DAO teeth in the BanklessDAO OpsGuild and coauthored the Sobol cartographer program proposal. I went on to serve as website project champion and cofounded the FRAG Stack, a community-incentivized decentralized front-end web stack (think JAMstack but running on Radicle and IPFS). I used my experience from this to cofound the Project Management Guild and the Modern Agilist Podcast to bring agile practitioners and Web3 Operators together. I served as the Governance Solution Engineer (GSE) lead in the first cohort, during which I collated the constitution and community handbook and introduced the improvement proposal standard. Lastly, I initiated and coordinated the following partnerships during season 5: ThriveCoin, Otterspace, and MintKuods+Academy.

### Lead Program Agilist
**UPMC Enterprises** | Jan 2019 - Feb 2023

Created and implemented the scaling strategy for the MyUPMC program (45 engineers). Reorganized all existing groups around cross-functional units (7 teams) and subject matter specialty groups (5 tribes). Founded the Agile Working Group (AWG) to collaborate with cross-department agilists and created the MyUPMC University to house all tribe learnings. Wrote the program's process handbook (MyUPMC Agility Handbook). Formulated the program's delivery metrics evaluation strategy (Data-Driven Agility). Communicated and socialized all of the above through monthly Agility talks, the corporate blog, recurring internal newsletters, and one-on-ones with product owners, engineering managers, and executive leadership.

### Program IT Team Manager
**Highmark** | June 2018 - Oct 2018

Established four new scrum teams (20 people) to assist in an enterprise CMS migration. Set up all standard scrum sessions and a nexus mechanism for cross-team coordination. Created and promoted an ETL-driven approach to migration that saved time, money, and quality. Worked very closely with a delivery manager to provide maximum transparency. Documented and highlighted the need for an application state map to executive leadership.

### Blockchain Consultant

Highly skilled at educating stakeholders on relevant and ongoing blockchain technology advancements and risks.

### Product Lead
**33 Mile Radius** | Jan 2015 - Sep 2016

33 Mile Radius acquired Ghost Army Software and its products and made me responsible to continue their development and integration into their own existing product line. I built a small engineering team, drove the feature roadmap, and developed new POC capabilities for executive team evaluation. I created the mobile app (hybrid) and used containerization to move our primary local app to the cloud and thereby make it multiuser capable. I lead a bi-weekly executive summary meeting showcasing development progress, new features, and release updates and set up a company-wide dashboard showing app analytics and sales data.

### Developer
**Sherwin-Williams** | June 2014 - Jan 2015

Contributed to their enterprise agile transformation during this time. Facilitated standard scrum sessions and promoted best practices with the agile coaches to leadership and my peers.

### Developer
**Truth for Life** | Mar 2013 - Jan 2014

Handled all front-end changes to the main website and created marketing landing pages. Managed usability and cross-browser testing, as well as maintaining email drip campaign lists.

Introduced cross-browser testing (Browserstack), bug reports (FogBugz), and project tracking (Trello). Dramatically increased productivity and transparency, boosting developer and executive morale through the introduction of agile methodologies and training (LeanDog).

### Developer
**Sherwin-Williams** | July 2011 - Jan 2013
